TagPiG is an auto tagging plugin for WordPress that completely automates your tag management.

== Description ==

TagPiG is an [auto-tagging plugin](http://blogpig.com/products/tagpig/)  for WordPress. TagPiG has been designed to overcome the manual bottle-neck by completely automating your tagging process. Here are some of the key features of TagPiG:

* Automatic post categorisation
* Automatic tag publishing
* Automatic tag filtering
* Automatic internal linking of common tags
* Automatic tag rotation

TagPig is simple to install and setup on your WordPress blogs. Once the plugin is activated it will run in the background, silently categorising, tagging and linking your blog posts automatically. With TagPiG installed you get all the great benefits of [auto tagging](http://blogpig.com/products/tagpig/) without any of the additional manual overheads.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest version of TagPiG from the BlogPiG [members' area](http://blogpig.com/members/)

2. Unzip the TagPiG zip file, it will contain one folder called _tagpig

3. Use an FTP client to upload the unzipped _tagpig directory into your WordPress /wp-content/plugins/ folder

4. Logon to your WordPress administration area and go to the PLUGINS tab, scroll down to TagPiG and click to activate the plugin

5. After activation a new BlogPiG tab will appear in your blog's administration area. This will be at the bottom of the sidebar. From here you can access the TagPiG admin area.

TagPiG requires a BlogPiG API key to activate. Follow the link on the admin page to get one. If you have previously acquired a BlogPiG API key for another BlogPiG plugin simply use the same API key as you used previously and the plugin will immediately activate.
